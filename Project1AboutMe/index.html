Project:  Project1-About Me
Name: Christian Durrant

I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.
 
Reflection: This assignment at first was something that I was worried about doing, it seemed like a lot of different things that would be hard to integrate together, 
especially as someone who never has worked in HTML. However this assignment was actually pretty simple, if a little time consuming. I feel like I've learned a lot of
useful skills that I will be able to use in future projects.

        <h2>A Haiku I Wrote</h2>
        <p>Sitting here writing this code, with soft music going and my wife next to me, things are better than I think they are.<br> 
        I just need to give the time to view the world at a slower pace </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            <em>Time slows and I think</em><br>
            <em>Peaceful is a man content</em><br>
            <em>And content I am</em><br>
        </p>

        <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>

        <p>I am an avid Dungeons and Dragons player. I've been playing for the better part of a decade since my dad introduced it into our family. 
            I played a lot in college down at Snow College where I started my schooling, but I really got into it with my high school friends. 
            I've DMed for many campaigns, most of them homebrew, and I have loved every second of it! 
            The ability to create art in a way that impacts people emotionally at such a high level is amazing to me, and I love being a part of that process!
        </p>

        <p>This segues well into another passion of mine: 3D Printing! I always wanted a printer as a teen, and when I got married, my uncle gifted me an old Anycubic i3 Mega
            that he used a lot before he got his new Bambu A1 printer. I've used the newly acquired printer to create the armies and various pieces of my games, though I haven't gotten much into actually designing 3D models.
            I hope to be able to get a new printer here around the holidays! I enjoy painting the miniatures as well and have become quite the hobby painter!
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I also love to read and play my trombone. I've gotten many chances to play in various city and private events over the years and it has truly become a passion of mine.
            When I'm not busy with anything else, I love nothing more than to curl up on the couch with a snack and read a book. I have loved reading Brandon Sanderson over the years,
            and have fallen in love with high fantasy books akin to his such as Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan or the occasional thriller by Michael Crichton!
